\chapter{Search for resonances decaying to two photons}
\label{chapter:diphotons}

In this chapter the search for resonant BSM prodoction of photons pairs is presented.
First the the analysis approach and event selections optimization are described, then
the statistical analysis and finally the results.

The analysis has been optimized for searches performed on data collected from proton-proton
collisions at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV. The optimization has been performed with
data collected during 2015 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \lumififBon.

\section{Data samples}
The search is perform in data collected by the CMS experiment during the year 2016. The total
integrated luminosity is \lumisix. Data are reconstructed witha detector calibration optimized
for the 2016 p-p collision datataking period.

The events were recorded with a trigger designed to select events containing a pair of
energetic photons with $E_T > 60$ GeV. The energy of each photon candidate is computed as
the sum of the energy measured by ECAL and HCAL and trigger selections require
the energy measured in HCAL to be less than $10(15)\%$ of that measured by ECAL for candidates
in the calorimeter barrel(endcap) region.

The trigger is found to be fully efficient for photons with $\pt > 75$ GeV and so an offline
selection is applied to select these events.

Together with the main analysis trigger another one is used to select electrons from \Zee decays.
The \Zee is the primary control sample of the analysis and events compatible with this process
are recorded with a single electron trigger that selects events with at least one electron of
$\pt > 27$ GeV and $|\eta| < 2.1$. Tight isolation and identification critaria are applied at trigger
level to maintain a rate compatible with the DAQ capabilities.
\Zee events are used to measure the final photon selection efficiency so the single electron trigger
is preferred over a double electron one, since in this way an unbiased set of electrons can be
constructed from those coming from \Zee decays that did not triggered the event acquisition.

\section{Monte Carlo simulated samples}
The Monte Carlo simulation of the CMS detector and 13 TeV p-p collisions is used. The simulation
takes into account both the pileup generated by concurrent interactions and the presence of
signals in the detector coming from collisions in other bunch crossing. Events in the simulated samples
are re-weighted to match the pileup energy density distribution measured in data.

\subsection{Resonant signal simulation}
\RS gravitons are chosen as a reference for the spin-2 resonance search. SM-like Higgs bosons of high mass and
fixed widths are used for the spin-0 case.
A set of simulation samples is used to model the detector response to resonant production of two photons.
Such samples are generated with PYTHIA8 in the mass range $500 < \mgg < 7000$ GeV in steps of 250 GeV for
masses below 4 TeV and 500 GeV above it. An additional set of samples without simulation of the detector
response are used to model the signal spectrum and the acceptance of the kinematic selections.
Three relative width hypothesis $\Gamma/\mgg$ are taken as benchmarks: $0.1\%$, $5\%$ and $5.6\%$ which,
in the case of \RS gravitons, correspond to a $k/M_{planck}$ of $0.01$, $0.1$, $0.2$ respectively.

\subsection{Standard model diphoton production simulation}
Even though the shape and yield of SM non-resonant diphoton production are measured with fit to the data,
simulated samples of the background processes are used for analysis optimization. A set of QCD induced
$\gamma+jet$ events generated with PYTHIA8 is used to optimize the photon identification selections.
The events are produced in several invariant mass bins in order to have a significant amount of photons and
jets over the whole $p_T$ spectrum.

\subsection{Drell-Yan production of electron-positron pairs}
Finally a set of Drell-Yan events ($Z/\gamma* \to e^{+}e^{-}$) is generated with aMC@NLO and is
used to derive data to simulation scale factors for the selections efficiency.

\section{Events selection}
Two measurement are needed to build the invariant mass of the diphoton system: the energy of the
photons and the interaction vertex position. The former is performed with the ECAL as described in
Section ??? while the latter is reconstructed with tracks produced in the interaction against which
the diphoton system recoils. Additional information from the tracker and the HCAL are used to discriminate
genuine photon candidates from QCD jets.
In the following paragraphs the vertex and photon identification algorithms are presented.

\subsection{Vertex identification}
The standard CMS reconstruction identify the primary interaction vertex as the one withing each
bunch crossing that as the largest $\Sum p_T^2$ (where the sum runs over all the charged particles
coming from the vertex). The method is not fully efficient for diphoton events since the two neutral
particles carry a significant amount of the transverse energy.
A dedicated boosted decision tree regression has been trained in the context of the search for the
Higgs boson decaying into two photons. Inputs to the regression are the $\Sum p_T^2$ and
other quantities related to the $p_T$ balance between the diphoton system and the charged particles.
Using this method the interaction vertex is correctly assigned for about $90\%$ of the signal events.

\subsection{Kinematic selections and event categorization}
Photons candidates are reconstructed from energy deposit in the ECAL with no associated track.
A set of kinematic selection is applied to avoid detector inefficiencies and shaping of the mass
spectrum due to trigger level selections:
\begin{itemize}
\item The transverse momentum of each candidate had to be above $75$ GeV.
\item The absolute value of the pseudorapidity of the supercluster (\absScEta) of both
candidates had to be below $\absScEta < 2.5$ and not between $1.444 < \absScEta < 1.566$,
due to the geometric acceptance of the ECAL.
\item To avoid a distortion of the background shape due to the transverse momentum
cut, the minimum invariant mass of the diphoton pair had to be $230$ GeV, when
both photons were detected in the ECAL barrel region (EB, $\absScEta < 1.444$). If one photon candidate
was detected in the endcap region (EE, $\absScEta > 1.566$), the minimum invariant mass
had to be $320$ GeV.
\end{itemize}

If more then one pair of photons satisfies the kinematic selection ($1\%$ of all the events) the pair
with the highest scalar sum of transverse momentum $p_T^{\gamma\gamma}$ is chosen.

The events are split into two categories accordingly to the topology of the photon system in relation
with the ECAL segmentation:
\begin{itemize}
\item barrel-barrel (EBEB): both photons are detected in the ECAL barrel region $\absScEta < 1.444$.
\item barrel-endcap (EBEE): one photon is detected in the ECAL barrel region $\absScEta < 1.444$ the other
  in one of the endcaps $1.566 < \absScEta < 2.5$.
\end{itemize}

The EEEE category (both photons detected in the endcaps regions) is not considered for the analysis
since only few percent of the benchmark signal events fall in this category and conversely the SM
background is considerably higher than in the other categories.

\subsection{Photon identification}
Energetic neutral pions found in QCD jets has a similar signature since they decay into two collimated
photons. A dedicated set of selection is applied to each photon candidate in the analysis to select a pure
sample of diphotons events. These criteria were optimized for photons with high transverse
momentum and based on the following variables:

\begin{itemize}  
\item \chIso: the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the particle flow charged hadron
candidates, which are assigned to the chosen primary vertex. Only candidate
within a radius of $\DeltaR < 0.3$ from the photon in the $\eta$ - $\phi$ plane, which is
defined as:
\[
\DeltaR = \sqrt{(\eta_\gamma-\eta_{cand})^2 + (\phi_\gamma-\phi_{cand})^2}
  \]
are considered.

\item \phoIso: the scalar sum of the transverse energies of the particle flow photon candi-
  dates for which $\DeltaR < 0.3$.
  
\item \hoe: ratio of the energy measured in the HCAL and ECAL.

\item \sieie: the weighted spatial second order moment of the photon candidate in the
  $\eta$-direction, computed as:
  \[
\sieie = \sqrt{\frac{\Sum_{i}{}}
    \]

\end{itemize}

Particle flow charged particles or photons sharing part of their energy with the photon candidates
are excluded from the \chIso and \phoIso sum.
