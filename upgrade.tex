\chapter{The upgrade of the CMS ECAL}
\label{chapter:ecal_upgrade}

In this chapter the upgrade of the LHC complex is briefly introduced in Section~\ref{upgrade_lhc}
underlining the physics goal and the expected performace of the machine. The CMS experiment is already planning
a series of upgrades, most of which will be installed during LS3 (Figure~\ref{fig:lhc_plan}).
The overall goal of the CMS upgrade is introduced in Section~\ref{sec:upgrade_cms} while
further details on the upgrade of the CMS ECAL are reported in the rest of the chapter.
The ECAL upgrade mainly concerns the read-out electronics and trigger system, these are introduced in Section ??
while in Section ??.

\section{High Luminosity LHC}
\label{upgrade_lhc}

The main objective of the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) upgrade [9] of the LHC accelerator complex
is to make precise measurements of the Higgs boson couplings, the standard model and provide a very
large dataset ($3000\fbinv$) for new physics searches.
The design include a substantial upgrade of the accelerator complex with the goal of reaching
a peak luminosity of $5\times10^{34} cm^{-2}s^{-1}$ (roughly four times as mush as the current value)
The integrated luminosity will about ten times the expected luminosity of the first twelve
years of the LHC.
The timeline of LHC and HL-LHC operation is sketched in Figure~\ref{fig:lhc_plan}, showing the planned
evolution of proton beam intensity through the remaining LHC operating periods (Run 2 and Run 3)
and the HL-LHC operating period following the upgrade of the accelerator complex in LS3.
The two periods of operation are termed Phase-1 (LHC) and Phase-2 (HL-LHC).



\section{HL-LHC upgrade of CMS}
\label{upgrade_cms}
The existing CMS calorimeters, described in Section~\ref{sec:cms_calo},
were designed [3, 6] to operate over 10 year of LHC operations at an instantaneous luminosity
of $\mathcal{L} = 1\times10^{34}\fbinv$ resulting in about 500 \fbinv. The HCAL will undergo a firt upgrade
during LS2 in order to safely operate at $\mathcal{L} = 2\times10^{34}\fbinv$.

The operating parameters of the High Luminosity
upgrade of the LHC accelerator complex, defined below, require a re-examination of the ability
of the detector active material and electronics to meet the requirements of up to 4500 fb âˆ’ 1 .
Based on the studies presented in Ref. [8], upgrades to the calorimeters are necessary.
